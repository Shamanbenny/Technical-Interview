Given an unordered list L containing all positive integer greater than 1. We want to find all possible pair(s) of numbers from the list such that the square of the first number equals to the second number. For example, a list [16, 9, 4, 7, 8, 3, 2, 3], the function will return [4, 16], [3, 9], [2, 4], and [3, 9], and a list [15, 2, 3, 6, 5, 1, 6, 7] will return [], and empty list.

### a. Use pseudocode to implement an algorithm that solve the above-mentioned requirements. Your program should meet the following requirements:

- INPUT - An unsorted list L of positive integer numbers.
- OUTPUT – Lists containing the pair of numbers such that the square of the first number equals the second number.

### b. Determine the algorithm’s time complexity of your algorithm using Big-Θ notation.

### c. Implement your algorithm in C++, Java, or Python programming language.

> Include in your program, the functionality to compute the time complexity of your algorithm and output the computed values. Is your computed value tally with the complexity that you derived from (b) above. Explain your output.
